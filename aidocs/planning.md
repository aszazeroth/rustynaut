# Planning: Broker-as-Clipboard Hub (Rooms)

## Current Intent (Agreed)
- Broker runs on a host; clients run in VMs.
- Clipboard sync is the MVP; chat is incidental.
- “One shared clipboard per room” (pub/sub by room).
- Transport: TCP only for now. Drop UDP. TLS + auth later (design should not block adding it).

## MVP Protocol (Text, line-framed)
We will use `LinesCodec` end-to-end (broker + client TCP) so that every message is a single UTF-8 line.

Suggested wire format (no JSON yet; human-readable + machine-parseable):
- Client → Broker:
  - `USER <name>` (sent once after connect)
  - `JOIN <room>` (defaults to `lobby` if omitted)
  - `CLIP <room> <b64>` (clipboard update)
  - `CMD <raw>` (slash command passthrough, e.g. `CMD /rooms`)
- Broker → Client:
  - `INFO <text>`
  - `ERR <text>`
  - `CLIP <room> <b64> <id>` (broadcast clipboard update with server-assigned id)

Notes:
- Base64 payload keeps clipboard binary-safe.
- `<id>` enables echo suppression (client should not re-send what it just applied).

## Architecture Targets
- Broker maintains:
  - Clients: `client_id`, `username`, `tx`, `room`.
  - Rooms: map `room -> set(client_id)` plus “last clipboard” metadata if needed.
- Clipboard broadcast scope: only within the sender’s room.
- Slash commands are broker-side (IRC-like). Minimal set:
  - `/help`, `/rooms`, `/join <room>`, `/who`, `/me`, `/ping`.  - `/shout <msg>` – broadcast to ALL rooms (global announcement).
## Implementation Roadmap
### 1) Stabilize framing + protocol
- Broker: keep `LinesCodec`, but stop formatting ad-hoc `"{username}: {msg}"` as the primary protocol.
- Client: switch TCP handling from `BytesCodec` + regex heuristics to `LinesCodec` parsing.
- Remove UDP module and `--udp` CLI flag.

### 2) Introduce explicit message parsing/formatting
- Add minimal parsing helpers (in each crate, no shared workspace crate):
  - Parse first line(s) as `USER` and optional `JOIN`.
  - Treat user input starting with `/` as a command (`CMD /...`).
  - Treat clipboard watcher events as `CLIP <room> <b64>`.

### 3) Broker rooms + routing
- Current state: peers already store `username` + `room`, but broadcasts are still global.
- Add a room-scoped broadcast helper (e.g. `broadcast_room(sender, room, msg)`), and use it for `CLIP` (and optionally `SAY`).
- Decide semantics for `JOIN`:
  - Send `INFO left <old_room>` / `INFO joined <new_room>` to the client.
  - Broadcast `INFO <user> joined <room>` / `INFO <user> left <room>` to that room.

### 4) Client clipboard loop suppression
- Track `last_applied_clip_id` per room (or globally for MVP).
- When applying a remote clipboard update, do not re-trigger sending the same clipboard back.
  - Practical approach: store last applied decoded string (or hash) + last id.

### 5) Observability + operability
- Broker uses `tracing` (already present). Add spans around connection lifecycle + room changes.
- Keep the ASCII banner printed first; push operational logs to `tracing`.

## Security/TLS/Auth Later (Design Hooks)
- Keep a stable “client id” concept server-side so auth tokens can bind to identities later.
- Keep protocol as line-based so it can run over TLS without changes.
- Plan for an `AUTH <token>` message in the future (no enforcement in MVP).

## Progress Tracking (Checklist)
- [x] Remove UDP from client and CLI parsing
- [x] Use `LinesCodec` on client TCP
- [x] Define and implement protocol messages (USER/JOIN/CLIP/CMD + INFO/ERR/CLIP)
- [ ] Implement broker rooms and room-scoped broadcasts
- [~] Implement broker slash commands (/help, /rooms, /who done; /join via JOIN line)
- [ ] Implement client echo suppression using `<id>`
- [ ] Manual test: start broker, connect 1 client, run `/rooms` and `/who`
- [ ] Manual test: 2 clients in same room sync; different rooms do not
